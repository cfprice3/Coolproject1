# Coolproject1
first group project


Our website allows the user to search for a brewery by city and state, then they can check the weather by searching a city. 
Two serverside APIs such as openbreweryDB and openweather allowed us to use their data to pull up breweries and weather in a searchable area.
The CSS framework Bulma allowed us to add detail and structure, so the website would be more visually appealing to the user.
We added a new third-party API to switch the website to darkmode if the user prefers, then they can switch back to normal by clicking again.
